Kick-started my career as a full-stack software engineer at [Lyon](https://lyon.com.ph) :hatching_chick:, and I quickly discovered my love for software architecture. The journey didn't stop there. Now, I'm leading the product over at [Boozt](https://boozt.io). Time does fly when you're writing code, doesn't it? üöÄ

## :telescope: Current Project 

Earlier in my career, I enjoyed contributing to open-source through Hacktoberfest üåê. Though my current role in a startup leaves less time for these contributions, it's been an exciting journey, with plenty of challenges but lots of learning at the same time! :books:

## :school_satchel: My Education

Studied Computer Science at De La Salle University in the Philippines. :computer:
